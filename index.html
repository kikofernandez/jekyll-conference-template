    <p class="lead">The DisCoTec series of federated conferences is one of the major events sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP).
      </p>
 It gathers three main conferences:

    COORDINATION (IFIP WG6.1 International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages)
    DAIS (IFIP WG6.1 International Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems)
    FORTE (IFIP WG6.1 International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems)

Together, these conferences cover a broad spectrum of distributed computing subjects, ranging from theoretical foundations and formal description techniques to systems research issues.

DisCoTec 2019 will take place at the Technical University of Denmark in June 18-21, 2019.
